### Cofee_machine 
*  What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, sugar, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money.

### Tic-Tac-Toe
*  Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and get playing!
*  After finishing this project, you'll get to know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using functions, handling errors, and processing user input.

### Credit_calc
*  Personal finances are an important part of life. Sometimes you need some extra money and decide to take a loan, or you want to buy a house using a mortgage. To make an informed decision, you need to be able to calculate different financial parameters. Let’s make a program that can help us with that!
*   You will practice using mathematics and Python in everyday tasks and learn how to use third-party modules and libraries. You will also learn more about different financial instruments.
   
### Simple_Chatty_Bot
*  Here, at the beginning of your programmer’s path, creating a simple console chat bot will do wonders to guide you through the basics of coding. During this journey you will also play some word and number games that you are going to implement all on your own. Pack up and let’s hit the road, my friend!
*  You’ll get to know the basic syntax of Python and write a simple program using variables, conditions, loops, and functions.

### Simple_Banking_System
*  Everything goes digital these days, and so does money. Today, most people have credit cards, which save us time, energy and nerves. From not having to carry a wallet full of cash to consumer protection, cards make our lives easier in many ways. In this project, you will develop a simple banking system with database.
*  In this project, you will find out how the banking system works and learn about SQL. We'll also see how Luhn algorithm can help us avoid mistakes when entering the card number. As an overall result, you'll get new experience in Python.
  
### Rock-Paper-Scissors
*  If you’ve ever wanted to create games, this project will get you started! In this project you will code a Rock-Paper-Scissors-Lizard-Spock game, a more advanced version of Rock-Paper-Scissors, which can be played against the computer.
*  A playable Rock-Paper-Scissors game, with a Player vs Computer mode. Practice using arrays, the Random library, formatted strings, and algorithms.
  
### Numeric_Matrix_Processor
*  Here’s a project for devoted matrix enthusiasts: learn to perform a variety of operations on matrices including addition, multiplication, finding the determinant, and dealing with inverse matrices. If you are working on your tech or math major, this project is a good chance for you to learn matrices in action and not just in your notebook.
*  Apart from learning a whole lot about matrices, you will become familiar with the Math library, recursion, and the many ways of using nested lists in practice.

### To-Do List
*  To-Do list can improve your work and personal life. You can use it to reduce the stress in your life and get more done in less time. It also helps you become more reliable for other people and save time for the best things in life. So let's implement it!
*  To-Do list that will help you manage your tasks. You will practice using loops, conditions and statement branches. And also you will learn the basics of SQLAlchemy to manage SQLite database on python!
  
### Regex_Engine
*  Regular expressions are a fundamental part of computer science and natural language processing. In this project, you will write an extendable regex engine that can handle basic regex syntax, including literals (a, b, c, etc.), wild-cards (.), and metacharacters (?, *, +, ^, $).
*  Learn about the regex syntax, practice working with parsing and slicing, and get more familiar with boolean algebra and recursion.

### Multilingual Online Translator
*  Everyone’s familiar with online translators. They giving us a handy way to translate on the go. In this project, you’re about to write an app that translates the words you type and gives you many usage examples based on the context.
*  You will learn to work with loops and conditions, pip and packages. You’ll be talking to the web with requests and handle the data with BeautifulSoup libraries.
  
### Password Hacker
*  All sorts of creatures lurk around the Internet, including trolls, pirates, miners – and hackers. In this project you’ll wear the hat of a real hacker. You must connect to a secret server without knowing the password. Your task is to write a Python program that can hack this password, and do so in the quickest way possible.
*  You will learn how hacking works. You will work with iterators and generators, and you’ll learn a little something about the itertools module – one of the most powerful features of Python. You will practice developing a client app and connecting to a server using the socket module. The project will also get you acquainted with JSON and the time module.
  
### Text_based_browser
*  Having the option to read online documentation or find something on the Internet from the command line or terminal can really come in handy. Let's use Python to create a text-based browser. In this project, you will create a simplified browser that will ignore JS and CSS, won't have cookies, and only will show a limited set of tags. But it will still be good enough for some situations, and building it will be fun!
*    In this project, you will learn how HTTP works and how to work with it in Python. You will become familiar with Python input and output. You will also need to parse HTML, so you'll get some experience with that, too.
    
### Smart Calculator
*  Calculators are a very helpful tool that we all use on a regular basis. Why not create one yourself, and make it really special? In this project, you will write a calculator that not only adds, subtracts, and multiplies, but is also smart enough to remember your previous calculations.
*    Apart from writing a useful program (everyone uses calculators!), you will learn a lot about lists, strings and dictionaries. You will also get closer experience with 2 important data structures: the stack and the queue.
    
### Tic-Tac-Toe with AI
*  Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses or X's and O's. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it's simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. Let’s program Tic-Tac-Toe and create an AI opponent to do battle with!
*  After finishing this project, you'll know a lot about planning and developing a complex program from scratch, using classes and functions, handling errors, and processing user input. You will also learn to use OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) in the process.
